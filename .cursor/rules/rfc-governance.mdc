# RFC Governance

## Numbering

- Sequential 4-digit zero-padded: `0009`, `0010`, `0011`...
- Check existing RFCs before assigning. No gaps, no reuse of retired numbers.
- Filename format: `NNNN-ShortName.md` (e.g., `0009-DistributedSync.md`)

## RFC Status Lifecycle

```
Draft -> Review -> Approved -> Implemented -> Locked
```

- **Draft:** Initial proposal. Open for major structural changes.
- **Review:** Design frozen. Only clarifications and security fixes.
- **Approved:** Ready for implementation. No design changes without new RFC.
- **Implemented:** Code exists and tests pass. Reference commit/PR.
- **Locked:** Normative and immutable. NEVER edit a Locked RFC (e.g., RFC-0000).

Status MUST be declared in RFC header. Backward transitions (e.g., Approved -> Draft) require explicit justification.

## Required Sections

Every RFC MUST contain these sections in order:

1. **Title and Metadata** -- RFC number, status, author, date
2. **Motivation** -- Why this change is needed. What problem it solves.
3. **Design** -- Technical specification. Data structures, APIs, algorithms.
4. **Security Considerations** -- Threat model specific to this RFC:
   - Attack vectors introduced or mitigated
   - Trust boundary changes
   - Cryptographic implications
   - Fail-open / fail-closed behavior
5. **Performance Impact** -- Latency, memory, CPU estimates. Benchmarks if available.
6. **Backward Compatibility** -- Breaking changes, migration path, deprecation timeline.
7. **Test Plan** -- What tests validate this RFC. Coverage expectations.
8. **Alternatives Considered** -- What was rejected and why.

## Cross-Reference Rules

- If an RFC depends on another RFC, include explicit link: `Depends on: RFC-NNNN`
- If an RFC supersedes another: `Supersedes: RFC-NNNN`
- Implementation references: `Implemented in: packages/core/src/core/<file>.ts`

## Security Review Gate

- Every RFC MUST have a "Security Considerations" section. Empty = rejected.
- RFCs introducing new IPC, network, or storage mechanisms require explicit threat model.
- RFCs modifying evidence lifecycle, hash chain, or signature generation are HIGH RISK and require extra scrutiny.

## Naming in RFCs

- Use Tracehound domain terminology (Scent, Evidence, Quarantine, Hound, Agent).
- New domain terms introduced in an RFC become canon upon Approved status.
- Do not redefine existing terms. Extend via composition, not redefinition.
