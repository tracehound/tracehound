# Residual Risk

The most critical section. Do not just write "secure".

Address the following topics:

- under which assumptions is it secure?
- which attack classes are out of scope?
- which invariants have not yet been proven?
- which areas have low fuzz coverage?

The auditor looks for this specifically.
