# Tracehound -- Project DNA

## Identity

Tracehound is a **deterministic runtime security buffer** for high-velocity APIs.
It is NOT a WAF, detection engine, APM, or SIEM tool.
Core concept: "WAF catches threats. Tracehound preserves evidence."

## Non-Negotiable Principles (RFC-0000)

1. **Decision-Free:** Tracehound does NOT detect threats. External detectors (WAF, ML, custom rules) do. NEVER add threat detection logic.
2. **Deterministic:** No ML, no heuristics in the hot path. All behavior must be explainable and reproducible.
3. **Payload-Less:** Raw payloads NEVER escape the quarantine boundary. Outside quarantine, only hashes and metadata exist.
4. **Fail-Open:** If Tracehound fails, the host application MUST continue operating. Tracehound is never a DoS vector.
5. **GC-Independent:** Explicit lifecycle management. No reliance on garbage collection for security-critical cleanup.

## Monorepo Structure

- `packages/core` -- Security engine (`@tracehound/core`). All security logic lives here.
- `packages/express` -- Express middleware adapter. Thin wrapper only.
- `packages/fastify` -- Fastify plugin adapter. Thin wrapper only.
- `packages/cli` -- CLI + TUI dashboard.
- `docs/rfc/` -- Normative design documents. RFCs govern all architectural decisions.

## Domain Terminology (RFC-0000 Canon)

Use ONLY these terms. Do not introduce synonyms or alternatives:
- **Scent** -- Incoming request/event metadata (NOT "request", "event", or "payload")
- **Evidence** -- Quarantined threat artifact with cryptographic integrity
- **Quarantine** -- Bounded evidence buffer with priority eviction
- **Hound** -- Isolated child process for evidence analysis (NOT "worker", "thread")
- **Agent** -- Stateless traffic orchestrator (NOT "handler", "controller", "processor")
- **AuditChain** -- Tamper-evident hash-linked operational log
- **Signature** -- Content-derived deterministic identifier for deduplication
- **Severity** -- `low | medium | high | critical` (no other levels)

## Change Control

- Any change to `packages/core/src/core/` MUST reference an RFC or explicit design rationale.
- Any new module in core MUST have a corresponding RFC (Draft or above).
- LOCKED RFCs (e.g., RFC-0000) are immutable. Do not propose changes to them.
- Breaking changes require CHANGELOG entry + migration notes.
