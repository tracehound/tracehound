## Phase 4 — Enterprise Hardening (v1.1.0)

**Goal:** Enterprise integration ready security component
**Timeline:** 4–6 weeks after v1.0.0

| Component                 | Description                                        | Priority |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| System Scheduler          | JitteredTickScheduler implementation (clean slate) | P0       |
| Working Memory Refactor   | Unified state substrate (Thread Ledger prereq)     | P0       |
| External Notification API | Read-only event emission (SIEM, SOC, pipelines)    | P0       |

| Evidence Lifecycle Policy | Declarative retention / eviction policies | P1 |
| Async Codec | `@tracehound/codec-async` - Streaming gzip | P1 |
| Cold Storage Adapters | `@tracehound/cold-s3`, `cold-r2`, `cold-gcs` | P1 |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Notification API introduces zero backpressure
- [ ] Policies remain deploy-time, not runtime-interactive

---

## Phase 5 — Forensics & Compliance (v1.2.0)

**Goal:** Forensic substrate and compliance enabler
**Timeline:** 4 weeks after v1.1.0

| Component                     | Description                                    | Priority |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Incident Verification Record  | Immutable, payload-less descriptor             | P0       |
| Deterministic Snapshot Export | Read-only system state for offline analysis    | P0       |
| Evidence Cost Accounting      | Memory + cold storage cost visibility          | P1       |
| Threat Coalescing             | Time-window aggregation for repetitive threats | P1       |
| DPS (Payload Summary)         | Deterministic summary for explainability       | P2       |

### Explicit Non-Goals

- Payload replay or re-execution
- Interactive dashboards
- Content inspection or mutation
- ML-based scoring

---

## Phase 6 — Argos & Behavioral Signals (v1.3.0)

**Goal:** Visibility beyond request lifecycle
**Timeline:** 6–8 weeks after v1.2.0

| Component                  | Description                                      | Priority |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| tracehound-argos           | Runtime behavioral observer (sampling-based)     | P0       |
| Behavioral Signal Protocol | Confidence-tagged signals for external detectors | P0       |
| Argos WorkingMemory        | Ephemeral aggregation substrate                  | P1       |
| Signal Rate Limiting       | Protection against signal flood                  | P1       |

### Architectural Invariants

- Argos signals NEVER enter Tracehound core
- Argos WorkingMemory is physically separate from Quarantine
- Sampling-only, no continuous observation
- No kernel, syscall, or memory dump access

### Success Criteria

- [ ] <1% CPU overhead under load
- [ ] Zero coupling with request lifecycle
- [ ] Core determinism guarantees preserved

## Phase 7 — Enterprise Integrations (v2.0.0)

**Goal:** Operationalize inside enterprise security stacks
**Timeline:** Post Argos stabilization

| Component            | Description                     | Priority |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| SIEM Exporters       | Splunk HEC, Elastic, Datadog    | P0       |
| Multi-Instance Coord | Redis-backed, non-authoritative | P1       |
| Compliance Reports   | SOC2 / HIPAA evidence export    | P1       |

---

## Phase 8 — Edge Runtime (v2.1.0)

| Component          | Description          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Cloudflare Workers | Edge-compatible core |
| Vercel Edge        | Edge-compatible core |
| Lambda@Edge        | AWS Edge integration |

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Locked)

These are **permanently excluded** to preserve product identity:

- Inline payload inspection (content-aware)
- Full observability dashboards
- Rule engines or detection logic
- ML-based classification
- WAF / RASP replacement features

---

## Roadmap Principles (Locked)

- Tracehound remains **decision-free**
- Detection is always **external**
- Payloads are **never exposed**
- Explainability > interactivity
- Forensics > visualization
